                <h1>Football (Soccer) Rules</h1>
                <p>Football (Soccer) is one of the oldest sports in the world and with that; itâ€™s also one of the most
                    recognised. The pinnacle of the international game comes in the form the Football World Cup. There
                    are also tournament such as the Euro Championships, Copa America and the African Cup of Nations.
                    Domestically the strongest leagues come from England (English Premier League), Spain (La Liga),
                    Italy (Serie A) and Germany (Bundesliga). In parts of the world the sport is also known as Soccer.

                </p>
                <h1>Object of the Game</h1>
                <p>The aim of football is to score more goals then your opponent in a 90 minute playing time frame. The
                    match is split up into two halves of 45 minutes. After the first 45 minutes players will take a 15
                    minute rest period called half time. The second 45 minutes will resume and any time deemed fit to be
                    added on by the referee (injury time) will be accordingly.

                <h1>Cricket Rules</h1>
                <p>Cricket is a sport that has been tracked back to the early 16th century and has been a popular ever
                    since. The pinnacle of the international game comes in the form of the Cricket World Cup. Other
                    major events include the T20 World Cup, Test Series and One Day series. Each country runs a host of
                    domestic competitions all highly competitive.</p>
                <h1>Object of the Game</h1>
                <p>The object of cricket is to score more runs than your opponent. There are three variations of the
                    game (Test, One Day and Twenty 20) and each give a certain timescale in which the game must be
                    completed.

                    To score a run you need to hit the ball with a cricket bat made from wood (usually English willow or
                    Kashmir). Whilst one team bats the other bowls and fields. The aim is to bowl the opposing team out
                    for as few runs as possible or restrict them to as few runs in the allocated time. After a team has
                    lost all their wickets or the allotted time has expired then the teams will switch roles.</p>

                <h1>badmintor Rules</h1>
                <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may
                    be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per
                    side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor
                    activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are
                    scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the other team's half of
                    the court.</p>
                <p>Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the
                    shuttlecock has struck the floor or ground, or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service
                    judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.[1]</p>
